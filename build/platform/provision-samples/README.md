# Provisioning to AWS CP/DP

For instructions to provision on the CP Dev Env see [AWS CP Dev Environment in Confluence](https://confluence.tibco.com/display/TCCS/AWS+CP+Dev+Environment).

Note that file names ending in `.local.yaml` are gitignored. You can create a copy
of the template files in this folder and rename the copy to `<your-file>.local.yaml`,
and then safely replace the placeholders with your values.
